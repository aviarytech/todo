/**
 * One-shot migration: re-mint legacy `did:peer:*` list assetDids as `did:cel:*`.
 *
 * Run after deploying this branch:
 *   npx convex run migrations/celAssetDids:runAll
 *   npx convex run --prod migrations/celAssetDids:runAll
 *
 * Two kinds of rows are rewritten, both matched by the `did:peer:` prefix:
 *  - genuine did:peer DIDs minted by @originals/sdk 1.x, before 2.0.0 dropped
 *    did:peer as a genesis layer;
 *  - `did:peer:temp-<ms>` placeholders that createListFromTemplate inserted with
 *    a "will be replaced with proper DID" comment. It never replaced them, so
 *    every list made from a *saved* template carries a DID that was never real.
 *
 * Genesis is minted server-side here, with NO keyStore configured. That is
 * deliberate: the genesis controller key would otherwise be held by the server
 * rather than the owner, which is a custody change this migration has no mandate
 * to make. The consequence is that migrated lists are VERIFIABLE (the envelope
 * carries the signed CEL log) but not AUTHORABLE — later CEL appends degrade to
 * cel:append-skipped, since no one holds the key. Lists created after this branch
 * ships keep their key client-side and are both. Making a migrated list authorable
 * requires re-genesis by its owner, which only the owner's browser can do.
 *
 * Idempotent — rows already on a non-did:peer DID are skipped, so a re-run after
 * a partial failure only touches what is left.

# Deployment Runbook

Checklist-format runbook for deploying and rolling back the Poo App stack.

**Stack:** React 19 frontend on Railway, Convex backend (cloud-hosted).

---

## 1. Deploy Frontend (Railway)

Railway auto-deploys from `main`. No manual steps needed for normal pushes.

**To trigger manually:**
- [ ] Open [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app) → project → service
- [ ] Click **Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit** (or push to `main`)

**Build command (auto-detected by Railway):**
```
bun install && bun run build
```

**Start command:**
```
bunx serve dist -s -l $PORT
```

---

## 2. Deploy Convex Backend

Run from the repo root (`app/`):

- [ ] Ensure `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is set in environment
- [ ] Run:
  ```
  npx convex deploy --prod
  ```
- [ ] Confirm output shows `Deployed Convex functions` with no errors
- [ ] Check [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) → Functions tab for any runtime errors

**CI deploy:** The `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` env var must be set in Railway (or CI secrets) for automated deploys.

---

## 3. Rollback Frontend (Railway)

- [ ] Open Railway dashboard → service → **Deployments** tab
- [ ] Find the last working deployment
- [ ] Click **⋯** → **Redeploy** on that deployment
- [ ] Wait for green status indicator

---

## 4. Rollback Convex

Convex does not have a one-click rollback. Deploy from the previous commit:

- [ ] `git checkout <previous-commit-sha>`
- [ ] `npx convex deploy --prod`
- [ ] `git checkout main` (or your current branch)

**Alternative:** Use the Convex dashboard to inspect function history and identify the last stable version.

## 6. Post-Deploy Verification

- [ ] Open `https://trypoo.app` — landing page loads
- [ ] Sign in with OTP — auth flow completes
- [ ] Create a list, add items — real-time sync works
- [ ] Open Convex dashboard → **Logs** — no error spikes
- [ ] Check Sentry — no new error spike in last 5 minutes
- [ ] Check PostHog → Live events — events flowing
- [ ] Stripe test: initiate a Pro subscription checkout — Stripe checkout page opens
- [ ] Open `/health` if health endpoint exists — returns 200

**If errors spike after deploy:** roll back immediately (see sections 3–4), then debug in staging.

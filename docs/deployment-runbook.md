# Deployment Runbook

Checklist-format runbook for deploying and rolling back the boop stack.

**Stack:** React 19 frontend on Railway, Convex backend (cloud-hosted).

---

## 1. Deploy Frontend (Railway)

Railway auto-deploys from `main`. No manual steps needed for normal pushes.

**To trigger manually:**
- [ ] Open [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app) → project → service
- [ ] Click **Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit** (or push to `main`)

**Build command (auto-detected by Railway):**
```
bun install && bun run build
```

**Start command without hosted Sites:**
```
bunx serve dist -s -l $PORT
```

**Start command with hosted Sites:**
```
bun server.ts
```

---

## 2. Deploy Convex Backend

Run from the repo root (`app/`):

- [ ] Ensure `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is set in environment
- [ ] Run:
  ```
  npx convex deploy --prod
  ```
- [ ] Confirm output shows `Deployed Convex functions` with no errors
- [ ] Check [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) → Functions tab for any runtime errors

**CI deploy:** The `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` env var must be set in Railway (or CI secrets) for automated deploys.

---

## 3. Rollback Frontend (Railway)

- [ ] Open Railway dashboard → service → **Deployments** tab
- [ ] Find the last working deployment
- [ ] Click **⋯** → **Redeploy** on that deployment
- [ ] Wait for green status indicator

---

## 4. Rollback Convex

Convex does not have a one-click rollback. Deploy from the previous commit:

- [ ] `git checkout <previous-commit-sha>`
- [ ] `npx convex deploy --prod`
- [ ] `git checkout main` (or your current branch)

**Alternative:** Use the Convex dashboard to inspect function history and identify the last stable version.

## 5. Environment Variables

### Railway runtime variables for hosted Sites

These are read by `server.ts`, which replaces static `serve dist -s` when Sites host routing is enabled.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_HOSTNAMES` | ✅ | Comma-separated app hostnames that should serve the React app, e.g. `boop.ad,www.boop.ad`. Other hostnames are treated as hosted sites. |
| `CONVEX_HTTP_URL` | ✅ | Convex HTTP actions URL used to resolve hosted-site hostnames. Can match `VITE_CONVEX_HTTP_URL`. |

### Cloudflare for SaaS setup

Cloudflare for SaaS is now wired through `convex/cloudflare.ts` + `convex/siteActions.ts`. To enable in production:

1. **Enable Cloudflare for SaaS on the `boop.ad` zone.** Cloudflare dashboard → boop.ad → SSL/TLS → Custom Hostnames. The product is available on every Cloudflare plan including Free; the first 100 hostnames are included, then $0.10/hostname/month up to 50,000.

2. **Set the fallback origin to `boop.ad`.** In the Custom Hostnames settings, set "Fallback Origin" to `boop.ad`. Customer-domain traffic flows: customer → CF edge (TLS terminated with the per-hostname cert) → CF proxies to `boop.ad` (the existing Railway domain) with the original Host header preserved → `server.ts` Host-header-routes to `serveHostedSite()`.

3. **Generate an API token.** Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token. Custom token with these permissions, scoped to the `boop.ad` zone:
   - `Zone:SSL and Certificates:Edit`
   - `Zone:Custom Hostnames:Edit`

4. **Set Convex env vars.**
   ```bash
   npx convex env set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN "<token>"
   npx convex env set CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID "<zone-id>"
   ```
   The zone ID is shown on the boop.ad zone overview page in the Cloudflare dashboard, right side panel.

5. **Confirm `VITE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_CNAME_TARGET` is set.** This is what the modal shows users as the CNAME target. Should be `boop.ad`. Set in Railway service env.

The 60-second `pollPendingCustomHostnames` cron picks up new hostnames and walks them from `pending_dns` → `pending_ssl` → `active`, then triggers the WebVH migration automatically.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Railway build)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | ✅ | Convex production deploy key (`prod:...`) — from Convex dashboard → Settings → Deploy keys |

## 6. Post-Deploy Verification

- [ ] Open `https://boop.ad` — landing page loads
- [ ] Sign in with OTP — auth flow completes
- [ ] Create a list, add items — real-time sync works
- [ ] Open Convex dashboard → **Logs** — no error spikes
- [ ] Check Sentry — no new error spike in last 5 minutes
- [ ] Check PostHog → Live events — events flowing
- [ ] Stripe test: initiate a Pro subscription checkout — Stripe checkout page opens
- [ ] Open `/health` if health endpoint exists — returns 200

**If errors spike after deploy:** roll back immediately (see sections 3–4), then debug in staging.

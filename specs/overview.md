# Shared List App — Overview

## Vision

A simple, real-time shared todo/grocery list for couples. Each list is an Originals asset with cryptographic provenance — you can see exactly who added or modified each item.

## Users

- **Primary:** Couples/partners who want to share grocery or todo lists
- **Use case:** "Add milk to the list" and your partner sees it instantly with proof you added it

## Goals

1. **Simple** — Create a list and share it in seconds
2. **Real-time** — Changes sync instantly between partners
3. **Provenance** — Every action is cryptographically attributable to a person
4. **Trustworthy** — Built on Originals protocol for verifiable history

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Bitcoin inscription (future feature)
- Due dates or reminders
- Multiple list types or categories
- More than 2 collaborators per list
- Mobile native apps (web-only for now)

## Success Criteria

- Two users can create and share a list within 30 seconds
- Items sync in under 1 second
- Clear UI showing who added/modified each item

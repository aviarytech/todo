# Implementation Plan

**STATUS: NOT INITIALIZED — AWAITING LISA INTERVIEW**

## Current State

- No `specs/` directory exists
- No `src/` directory exists
- No git tags exist
- Project requires initialization via Lisa (planning agent)

## What Happens Next

Ralph (builder) cannot proceed until Lisa completes the following:

1. **Interview the user** to gather requirements:
   - Vision & Purpose (what to build, who for, why)
   - Technical Constraints (language/framework, integrations, deployment)
   - Core Features (3-5 must-haves, explicit out-of-scope)
   - Quality & Constraints (performance, testing philosophy)

2. **Create `specs/` directory** with application specifications

3. **Populate this plan** with prioritized, actionable tasks

## To Initialize

Run Lisa using: `./loop.sh lisa`

---

*This file will be replaced by Lisa after the interview is complete.*
